## Status

Status: Proposed

## Context

Creating a whole new note just to add an event to the calendar seems redundant

## Decision

Proposed to implement a functionality that allows the user to add events and to-do lists inside the note.

## Consequences

Will need to figure out a way to create events and to-do lists inside of notes, might be a complicated process but it will get rid of redundancy
