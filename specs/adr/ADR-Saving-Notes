# Saving Notes decision record

## Status

The status: Proposed

## Context

Currently to save a current note we need to click a new note button. We want to make this procedure easier for the user

## Decision

Discussed implementing save on enter, so that once user clicks enter the note is saved.

## Consequences

This will save the user's time when saving the new note but it might be confusing if they want to start a new paragraph with enter, so they will need to do enter+shift
