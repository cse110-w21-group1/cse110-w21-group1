# Update notes

## Demo of Current App
- Split up the work 
1. Login
2. Main page
- Dummy note and calendar
- Navigation bar
- Big portion of work was figuring out routing between home page and calendar
- Main goal was to create a skeleton of the app with some basic navigation.

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Read off of the pipeline md and explain

## Team Health
- So far team has been communicating well, no disputes and everyone has been clear and concise
- Team has been a little bit confused this past weekend because of pushing errors and development learning curve
- Team has also been a bit stressed because of the recent midterm week, so time availability is also tight.

## Challenges
- Adjusting to the github branch hierarchy and actions
- Getting the team adjusted to the CI/CD pipeline
- Pushing too early and to the wrong locations
