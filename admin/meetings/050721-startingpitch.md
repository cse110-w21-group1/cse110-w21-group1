# Agenda

**Systems Diagram - Revise**
- What controllers do we need for the architecture?
    - Single-page application: The web component that the user dynamically interacts with
    - Navigation controller: The controller that controls the "tab" selected (Notebook vs Calendar)
    - Calendar Controller: Controls the UI and user interaction with the calendar
    - Note View Controller: Controls the actual text-editor and sidebar menu of the note tab
    - Search Controller: The controller that forwards the input into the note management system to query the database
    - Drop Down Menu Component: Filters the notebook by querying for types in the database
    - Note Management System: The interaction between the UI and the database
    - Database: Contains the JSON objects and database for logging in and note management.
