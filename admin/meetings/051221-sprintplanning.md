# Agenda

**Discuss CD/CI Pipeline**

Branches management: 
- Branches by Category
    - Design branch (CSS/HTML)
    - Development is the working app but not finished product, any team changes go there. Once everything is tested there it goes to the main
        - Feature 1 branch
        - Feature 2 branch
    - main is the production branch
    
- Make sure all branches are updated
- Slack branch channel - make sure to notify everyone about changes
- Assign tasks through github issues
- Have each member self-assign roles
- At the start, all members will be focused on design in HTML and CSS (comes before JS and integration).

Hierarchy:
- main
    - design
    - development
        - feature 1
        - feature 2

Linting and code style enforcement (may happen in pipeline and/or in editor)
- Visual studio code formatting
- Prettier extension

Code quality via tool  (ex. Codeclimate, Codacy, etc.)
- Decided to go with CodeFactor
- Integrates with github and slack and is free

Code quality via human review (ex. Pull Requests)
- Your code should be functional and doesnâ€™t contain obvious errors
- All the features should be manually reviewed by the team member before pushing to development
- Group check meetings where we batch the pull requests


Unit tests via automation (ex. Jest, Tape, Ava, Cypress, Mocha/Chai, etc.)*
- Decided to go with Mocha as it has a clear documentation

Documentation generation via automation (ex. JSDocs)
- Decided to go with JSDocs

**Closing Notes**
- Fill out when2meet to decide on time / date for actual sprint
- Start thinking about what role you want to play after the HTMl / CSS is designed out

**Meeting End: 3:00pm**

# For Next Time
