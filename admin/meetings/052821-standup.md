# Agenda
**Check in to progress**

Saving Issue with Database

- Notes previously stored as a hashmap of title + date
- How to get which note is currently selected?
    - Reference notes by index in array (ID) instead of hashed title + date
- Multiple arrays not necessary, will try to create one centralized array

Event Tag and Date

- James finished it, so calendar team can begin implementing events after the database (ID as index) is updated
- Merged reminders pull request (James)

- Charles, Kyle, Geewhan, and Alvin will work on the save feature of notes into the database

Design and styling
- Will group the styling and design until the end once the core features have finished.


Design decisions
    - One centralized array as a database to store notes
    - Save by index instead of hashed title + date

**Meeting End: 4:00pm**
