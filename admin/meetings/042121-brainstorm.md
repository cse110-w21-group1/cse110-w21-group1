# Agenda

**Brain Dump**
- Created a mind map of what a bullet journal acting as a Day Planner should include
- Collaborated where each person added what they believed should be in the BuJo.

**Narrow down the ideas**
- Out of all the ideas, selected the main priority to focus on and what are "nice to haves".
- Define "Must haves" and "Nice to haves"
- Designated creating blank pages and text manipulation as the primary focus to begin with
- Tagging, navigation, and basic BuJo templates are under Must haves, while design and other features are under nice-to-haves.

**Conclusion - 3:00pm**
- Main Idea: Creating a robust note-taking software first, and then implementing the Bullet Journal features over it.
- Organized needed featuers and nice to have features
- Got a general idea of the implementation order for the Bullet Journal.

# For Next Time
- Wireframe Design
- Designating roles
