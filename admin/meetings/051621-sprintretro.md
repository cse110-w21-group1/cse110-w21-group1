# Agenda
**Review Progress**

Calendar - Kyle and Brandon
- No framework yet, but found an API to use: https://fullcalendar.io/
- Assigned to create a dummy page to be able to set up routing before the team status video

Login in Page Pull Request
- Actually works, but seems to be a weird bug on Victoria's end
- Able to log in to the app (no authentication yet without fyrebase)
- Pulled to main

Notes Page
- Basic UI and layout design
- Did some styling and CSS
- Split the left notes bar into a container and the right note editor into a separate container with some padding.
- Framework and interaction not ready yet
- Requested a pull request to main for the notes page and will accept once sent

Fyrebase
- Attached the fyrebase to the project
- Actual implementation Elias is waiting for the notes and calendar implementation

Navigation Bar STyling
- Did some styling, but waiting for notes page and calendar to actually route to
- Going to wait for Kyle to finish setting up a dummy calendar page.

**Closing Notes**
- Good progress on the log in page and the styling aspect
- Main notes page still needs interaction
- The rest of the components are waiting for the other components to finish before they can move on.
    - Fyrebase waiting for notes and calendar page actual implementation
    - Nav bar waiting for the dummy calendar page to route to

After the meeting:
1. ~~Victoria and I resolving the conflicts so the main notes into main~~
2. Kyle and James create a dummy component for calendar
3. Routing between the components
4. Team status video meeting (Brandon and Victoria)
    

**Meeting End: 4:00pm**

# For Next Time
- Finish the router.js so nav bar works (preferably before the team status video) - Estimated time of completion at 6
- Start implmementing API for calendar
- Retrospective - Monday
- Next sprint on Wednesday
