# Agenda

**Revising Nogos and Rabbit Holes**
- No gos are outside of the scope completely
- Exporting to other platforms will be a no go as we do not need our app to be interoperable with 3rd party note taking applications.
- Collaboration is also a no go as bullet journals are a personal item, and don't need multiple people to edit a bullet journal. 

**Wireframes**
- Calendar
    - Decided to allow a user to select a date for a specific note. This will add it to the calendar.
    - When you select the note on the calendar, it will go to that note.
    - How to switch months and year?
        - Zoom out functionality?
        - We decided to go with arrows to select the month, and a drop down to select the actual year
        - Too much unknowns in zooming out and selecting years.
 - Sign in Page
    - Decided to keep sign out button as its own easy button to use
    - Sign in Page to allow username and password input
    - Gradient background for design
    - Do not include forgot password yet as that is a rabbit hole (sending email, etc.)
 - Also made a copy of the sign in page to act as the sign up page

**Design Choices and ADR**
- What design choices have we decided on for the project?
- Tagging
    - How are we going to tag events on the calendar?
        - Main concern: If we make a separate note for every event, will you just have an empty note for an event e.g. "Mike's Birthda"?
        - Solution: Allow tagging of not only the note itself, but also individual text items.
        - The main page itself will be put on the calendar for the date it was created.
 - Filter
    - Can filter events, tags, notes through search bar
    - Can also filter alphabetically, numerically, etc. to display on the side bar
