# High Points to take away

**Issues that can be improved**
- Code styling is very important, make sure to have proper styling because it impacts the legibility for other coders.
- Need more organization in terms of feature development. Different features not working ended up being roadblocks for other team members along the line.
- Need to be more clear in group communication - there were some members who did not know there was a meeting.

**How did we do in progress?**
- Core functionality is present, so we met our minimum requirements which was our goal for this sprint.
- Did not have time to touch on "nice to have" features, but will continue testing and see if we have time to implement more features.

**Team Health**
- The team had no conflicts during this second sprint.
- Because it is approaching second midterms and finals, as well as general heavy workload from other classes, some team members found it hard to have time to work on the project.
- Overall though, we had good communication and regular stand up status updates to communicate changes and update progress.
