# Agenda

**Problem**
- What problem are we trying to solve for the user?
- Having to switch between project management / note taking and scheduling, better to integrate as one product.

**Appetite**
- Asked what our appetite for the project was?
    - Must have functionalities
    - Time constraints for the project (4 weeks)
    - Limited technology set by the project
    - What are the appetites actually asking for? We figured it was main constraints for the project that we can focus on.
- Is the features required by the school (according to the TA) part of the appetite or the core features in the solution?
- One of our unique features will be dynamic / custom templates for BuJo pages.

**Rabbit Holes and No Gos**
- Difference between Rabbit Holes and No Gos
    - Rabbit Holes are items we want to get to, but if we dive into it right now it will take a while so for the first version is not necessary.
    - No Gos are items we are not going to include in the project at all, or are not crucial to solving our problem or appetite. 
- What are our Rabbit Holes?
    - Multimedia inserts, because we would need to store the files and uploaded objects into a cloud-based server, which is way outside the scope of this project. This will also take up a lot of development time and research.

- What are our No Gos?
    - Security: Hard to implement security on limiited time frame, and not necessary for now
    - Payment: Not planning to collect revenue through any payment services
    - Login Features: No need for user to log in / authentication. (How are we going to differentiate users and save their notes though?)

# For Next Time
- Ask TA "Is the features required by the school (according to the TA) part of the appetite or the core features in the solution?"
- Ask TA about coding requirements, are we able to use external libraries in our web app? Database collection?
- Have TA review our No Gos and Rabbit Holes

**After TA Check in**
- Submit starting pitch to Canvas and plan out when to present in the week
- No Gos and outside the scope completely, so login and security would not be no gos.
- Design choices / ADR document 
- Create a systems diagram (flowchart and system architecture diagram) on the slides as well
