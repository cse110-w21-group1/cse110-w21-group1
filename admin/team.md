## Meet the Team

**Brandon Wang - Frontend Designer** - https://b1wang.github.io/AboutMe/
> Hello! I am one of the Team Leads for Page One, and I am a third year Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation (what a mouthful) with a minor in Computer Science. I am from the Los Angeles area, and I love stock daytrading and motorsports! I am also in the process of developing an IOT product using Arduinos and ZigBee protocol on RF chips which have been in the works for a year. My dream is to become an entrepeneur straight out of college, and has been my personal goal for as long as I can remember.
