## Meet the Team

**Brandon Wang - Frontend Designer** - https://b1wang.github.io/AboutMe/
> Hello! I am one of the Team Leads for Page One, and I am a third year Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation (what a mouthful) with a minor in Computer Science. I am from the Los Angeles area, and I love stock daytrading and motorsports! I am also in the process of developing an IOT product using Arduinos and ZigBee protocol on RF chips which have been in the works for a year. My dream is to become an entrepeneur straight out of college, and has been my personal goal for as long as I can remember.

> Hellooooo! I’m Julia and I’m a junior studying Computer Science. I like hanging out with my friends, exploring boba tea places, baking, art, fashion, skincare, traveling, listening to music, and watching movies/tv shows/anime. I just finished the anime “The Promised Neverland” recently, highly recommend it! Career wise, I’m interested in SWE, but I’m also exploring UIUX for a bit to see what I like the most.

**James Nguyen - Backend Coder** - https://jkn006.github.io/CSE110-Repository/
> Hey! I'm James Nguyen a second year Computer Engineering major. Some thing I enjoy doing in my free time is exercising and eating good food afterwards. I have worked on projects in the past that involved GUI design and data aquisition for project teams I have been a part of. My goals are to work in the aerospace industry some time in the future and build technology that will drive the future.
